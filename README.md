## üöÄ Getting Started

Let's start the main script!

cd Amazon-IT-Price-Tracker
python3 main.py
```

![Main Menu Image](https://github.com/Bomberfra23/Amazon-IT-Price-Tracker/blob/v0.0.1/images/mainmenu_Image.png)

if you see this screen probably you are on the right way. Just configure two more options and we are ready!

### Threads Setting

In order to make several requests in parallel, this software has a multi-thread workflow. The more threads you enable,
the more products you can monitor at the same time but
also the more CPU, RAM and I/O you will consume. If you have very powerful hardware/internet bandiwdth and want to have
the greatest performance from this software, my advice is
to set the number of threads equal to the number of product that you have filled in. If you have like thousands of
products and speed is not a problem, my advice is to set the number
of threads equal to double the number of CPU cores that you have.

### Delay Time Setting

You can also configure the delay time in seconds between cycle of product monitoring tasks. My advice is that the
perfect number is around 900 seconds.

### Products Scraping

Once you have configured all the previous settings, Amazon IT Price Tracker will start to monitoring products for you.
Directly on the console you can see real-time information for every product:
request time, title and actual price.

you via email or Telegram Bot message. (more features on the way).
